This wide difference could be explained by different timing of personality assessment, different methodologies of personality assessment, and different definitions of DSH in each study. For example, in majority of studies except the study by Haw et al. (2001), personality assessments were carried out within days to a fortnight following the index DSH when the subjects were still suffering from acute mood disturbance. The prevalence of BPD might have been over-inflated due to the state on trait bias in these studies. On the other hand, some studies employed self report measures (Haw et al., 2001) and informant-based structured interview (Dirks, 1998) for diagnosis of BPD and that might have led to systematically different results from those using clinician-administered structured interviews including SCID-II. In addition, the different definitions of DSH might also influence the prevalence of PDs. While a majority of the studies used the WHO definition of parasuicide which does not specify lethal intent, Berk et al. (2007) used the definition by O\\u201a\\u00c4\\u00f4Carroll et al.

Moreover, Parkin heterozygous deletion accompanied by APC heterozygous deletion promotes intestinal adenoma development in mice. As HCC appears in the mice at advanced age, and there is a dependency between Parkin and APC mutations in adenoma development, it is possible that a mutation in Parkin alone is not sufficient to initiate development of some types of cancer, and it may require additional risk factors. Moreover, we identified Parkin interacting proteins in melanoma cells by immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The proteins detected are mainly connected to cell cycle, mitochondrial function, and proteasome function; this result is consistent with the study of Sarraf et al. (2013).
